      Skully808 is definetely an extension of me, his brain is constantly on fire but he quells it with his love for music. I chose to use After Effects since ive never used it before and I figured itd be a good challenge. What I made was actually very close to to what I imagined the only issues I faced was getting Skully to come at the screen swiftly and not akwardly 
      so I tried my best to do so. I used Audacity for the audio tracks in which I found a very ambient and cinematic trap beat which the beggining sounds extremely simliar to thingsd ieven lkisten to today. I chose this music for the Skullies because of the fact they are all bone and can only really feel vibrations, therefore skully"808" specializes in bass heavy music!! 
      A genre me and him both share. I wanted this to convey a sense of awe and a yearning to watchj it again because of tghe composition of sounds to events, I tried my best to match up a phased out mechanuicla sound i found to start right whenthe stars start spinning./ I hiope its as satiosfying to watch as it was for me to make, Enjoy.
